basically i typed a wrong password when running  "unzip misDIrection.zip"
i got the output i copied in extract_output file !

I noticed numbers goes from 1 to 36 , and right before them there is {Letters and numbers}/
So i quicly said  : why not sort the numbers (as keys to their values) .

so i made format.py for that .

which ended up giving me base64 hash , decoded it and got the flag .

rate : easy .
